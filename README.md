<h1 align = "center"> Dynamic Programming Question </h1>

A. Problem statement:

Given a sequence of numbers you have to find out the longest alternating subsequence and print the length of the subsequence. A sequence is an alternating sequence when it will be maintain like (increasing) -> (decreasing) -> (increasing) -> (decreasing) or (decreasing) -> (increasing) -> (decreasing) -> (increasing).

<h1 align = "center"> Minimum Spanning Trees </h1>

B. Problem statement: 

Create a program either using Java or Python that will perform Minimum Spanning Tree Using Kruskal Algorithm.

Follow these steps involved in Kruskal’s Algorithm to generate a minimum spanning tree:

Step 1: Sort all edges in increasing order of their edge weights.
Step 2: Pick the smallest edge.
Step 3: Check if the new edge creates a cycle or loop in a spanning tree.
Step 4: If it doesn’t form the cycle, then include that edge in MST. Otherwise, discard it.
Step 5: Repeat from step 2 until it includes |V| - 1 edges in MST.
Using the steps mentioned above, you will generate a minimum spanning tree structure. So, now have a look at an example to understand this process better.

The graph G(V, E) given below contains 6 vertices and 12 edges. And you will create a minimum spanning tree T(V’, E’) for G(V, E) such that the number of vertices in T will be 6 and edges will be 5 (6-1).
